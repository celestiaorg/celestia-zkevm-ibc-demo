# ZK-EVM X Celestia Token Transfer Demo

> ⚠️ **Warning**
> This repository is a work in progress and under active development.

This repo exists to showcase transferring tokens to and from a Cosmos SDK chain (representing Celestia) and a ZK proveable EVM using the [IBC-Eureka solidity contracts](https://github.com/cosmos/solidity-ibc-eureka/blob/main/README.md). The diagram below is meant to detail the components involved and, at a high level, how they interact with one another.

For more information refer to the [architecture document](./ARCHITECTURE.md). Note that the design is subject to change.

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
1. Install [Rust](https://rustup.rs/)
1. Install [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)
1. Install [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
1. Install [Just](https://just.systems/man/en/)
1. Install [SP1](https://docs.succinct.xyz/docs/getting-started/install) (for end-to-end tests)

### Steps

1. Fork this repo and clone it
1. Set up the git submodule for `solidity-ibc-eureka`

    ```shell
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    ```

1. Install contract dependencies and sp1 tendermint light client operator binary in solidity-ibc-eureka which is a requirement before deploying contracts

    ```shell
    make install-dependencies
    ```

1. Start a local development environment

    ```shell
    make start
    ```

    > [!TIP]: Double check that all 5 containers are started. Currently: the bridge might fail because it depends on the validator being available. If this happens, wait until the validator is available then start the bridge and beacond node again.

1. Set up IBC Clients and Channels:

    - Generate the `contracts/script/genesis.json` file which contains the initialization parameters for the `SP1ICS07Tendermint` light client contract.
    - Initialize Groth16 light client on simapp.
    - Create a channel on simapp.
    - Deploy IBC contracts on the Reth node.
    - Create a channel on the reth node.
    - Create a counterparty on the reth node. (it will be pointing to groth16 client ID on simapp)
    - Create a counterparty on the simapp. (it will be pointing to tendermint client ID on reth)

    ```shell
    make setup
    ```

### Helpful commands

```shell
# See the running containers
docker ps

# You can view the logs from a running container via Docker UI or:
docker logs beacond
docker logs celestia-network-bridge
docker logs celestia-network-validator
docker logs simapp-validator
docker logs reth

# State is persisted in the .tmp directory. Remove .tmp to start fresh:
rm -rf .tmp
```
